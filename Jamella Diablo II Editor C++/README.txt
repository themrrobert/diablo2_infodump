I downloaded jamella-diablo-ii-source-code.pdf a long time ago.
It took forever to download.
Even the filename is original (from the website I downloaded it from 3+ years ago).

When Jamella released his C++ source code for his Diablo II Character editor it was in a PDF file.
I ripped the ASCII/UTF-8 text out of the PDF file (ie. jamella-diablo-ii-source-code.pdf) and put/poured/piped it into the file all_C++.txt

If the "all_C++.txt" is not to your tastes, the pdf2c++/ directory/folder has clues that may help you get the C++ out the PDF as quickly as possible.

In jamella-diablo-ii.source-code.pdf there is text representing files that were not C++ source code files (ie. text in files that were not in .cpp or .h files) like JamellaD2E.rc

JamellaD2E.rc is a Microsoft Developer Studio generated resource script from a Visual Studio older than Visual Studio 2010.
