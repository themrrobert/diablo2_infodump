I deleted this diablo 2 repository 3 days ago.
I deleted all of my github repositories.
This was the only repository I ever had that was Diablo II related.

Begins with Diablo 2 scripts I made back in 2010 LOL

None of the 3 have been tested.
They're so fresh out of a MySQL 5.1.51 text-based dump (ie. mySQL dump
version 10.13)!

It has been 2383 days (since November 8, 2010) when I was done with with these
3 scripts and I froze them into that dump from an unknown OS. I'm 38% sure it
was on a computer that had Debian that I'm 70% sure was originally installed
with Debian 3.0r2 back in 2004. Hmm. I used Debian 3.0r2 (obviously while doing
`apt-get upgrade`) for 6 years?...................WUT?! Does Debian remain a
3.0r2 after doing `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`? I'm 29.248643% sure
Debian would remain at 3.0* until an `apt-get dist-upgrade`

$ echo '2383 / 365.2425' | bc -l | egrep -o '^[0-9]+'
6
$ echo '2383 % 365.2425' | bc
191.5450
$ echo '191.5450 / 30.44' | bc -l
6.29254270696452036793
$ echo '.29254270696452036793 * 30.44' | bc -l
8.90499999999999999978

So there you have it. I have been waiting
6 years, 6 months, 9 days before reviving these scripts since getting dumped.
