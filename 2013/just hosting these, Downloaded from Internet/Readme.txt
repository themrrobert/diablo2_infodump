July 26, 2017:
The executables (ie. .exe files) need to be studied before running.

------------------
I got these files from:
- Paul Siramy's Website directory (almost everything in ./source-code/)
  (ie. 
    http://paul.siramy.free.fr/_divers/
    http://paul.siramy.free.fr/_divers2/
    http://paul.siramy.free.fr/_divers3/
  )
  (paul.siramy@free.fr)
- Phrozen Keep (eg. the itempacks)
  (ie. http://d2mods.info)
- Tom Amigo's website (one of the mpq's in ./source-code/)
  (ie. http://www.angelfire.com/sc/mpq/)
- Zezula's website for stormlib in ./source-code/
  (ie. http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html#StormLib)
- PlugY Website (ie. http://plugy.free.fr/en/index.html)
- And probably other files from somewhere else as well.

I practically got none of these files from myself.
I'm just hosting them because they should be findable on Google.
Enjoy!
